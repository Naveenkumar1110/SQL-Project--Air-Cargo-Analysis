  on c.customer_id = p.customer_id
  group by c. first_name, p. class_id 
  having p.class_id= "economy plus";

9.Write a query to identify whether the revenue has crossed 10000 using the IF clause on the ticket_details table.
 
  select sum(Price_per_ticket)as Total_revenue, if (sum(Price_per_ticket) >10000 , "yes" , "no" )as 
  Reveune_crossed_or_not from ticket_details;

 Also, return an error message if the table doesn't exist.
  
  

17.Write a query to create a stored procedure that extracts all the details from the routes table where the travelled distance is more than 2000 miles.
   
 Create table route_details 
 (route_id int,
 flight_num int,
 origin_airport char,
 destination_airport char,
 aircraft_id varchar(20),
 distance_miles int,
 unique(route_id),
 check(distance_miles>0)
 );

18.Write a query to create a stored procedure that groups the distance travelled by each flight into three categories. 
   The categories are, short distance travel (SDT) for >=0 AND <= 2000 miles, 
   intermediate distance travel (IDT) for >2000 AND <=6500, and 
   long-distance travel (LDT) for >6500.

   select *,
   case 
   when distance_miles >=0 AND distance_miles <= 2000 then "short distance travel (SDT)"
   when distance_miles >2000 and distance_miles <= 6500 then "intermediate distance travel (IDT)"
   when  distance_miles >6500 then "long-distance travel (LDT)"
   end as categories
   from routes;


19.Write a query to extract ticket purchase date, customer ID, class ID and specify if the complimentary services are provided for the specific class using a stored function in stored procedure on the ticket_details table.
   Condition:

   If the class is Business and Economy Plus, then complimentary services are given as Yes, else it is No


   select p_date, customer_id, class_id,
   CASE

    else 'No' 
   end as Complimentary_service   
   from ticket_details
   order by customer_id;
   


20. Write a query to extract the first record of the customer whose last name ends with Scott using a cursor from the customer table.

    delimiter %%
    
   CREATE PROCEDURE scott ()
   BEGIN DECLARE a VARCHAR(255);
   DECLARE b VARCHAR(255); DECLARE cursor_1  CURSOR FOR SELECT last_name FROM customer
   WHERE last_name='scott';
   END;
   %% delimiter
   
   note : their is no customer who's last name is "scott"
